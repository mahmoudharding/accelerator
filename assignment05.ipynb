You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on a question, so ask a post to the discussion board or ask your instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, click **File** again and choose **Hub Control Panel** and select **Stop My Server** to shut it down. Then, after a few moments select **Start My Server** to start it back up.
