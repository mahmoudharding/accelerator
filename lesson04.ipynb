    "## Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often desirable to use a few numbers to summarize a data set. One important aspect of a set of data is where its center is located. In this lesson, measures of central tendency are discussed first. A second aspect of a distribution is how spread out it is. In other words, how much the data in the distribution vary from one another. The second section of this lesson describes measures of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: The mean of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Median: The median of a set of data is the value in the middle when the data is in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mode: The mode is the element of the data set that occurs most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measures of Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the mean and median, which are measures of the “typical” or “middle” value, we also need a measure of how “spread out” or varied each data set is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Deviation : The standard deviation is a measure of variation based on measuring how far each data value deviates, or is different, from the mean. A few important characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Standard deviation is always positive. Standard deviation will be zero if all the data values are equal, and will get larger as the data spreads out.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Standard deviation has the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers."

    "## Contingency Table\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, a contingency table (also known as a cross tabulation or crosstab) is a type of table in a matrix format that displays the (multivariate) frequency distribution of the variables. They are heavily used in survey research, business intelligence, engineering, and scientific research. They provide a basic picture of the interrelation between two variables and can help find interactions between them. The term contingency table was first used by Karl Pearson in \"On the Theory of Contingency and Its Relation to Association and Normal Correlation\",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table#cite_note-1) part of the Drapers' Company Research Memoirs Biometric Series I published in 1904.
