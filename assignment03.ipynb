You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on a question, so ask a post to the discussion board or ask your instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

    "The two building blocks of Python code are **expressions** and **statements**.  An **expression** is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "\n",
    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",

    "Here are two expressions that both evaluate to 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 - 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                     |\n",
    "|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",
    "| `round`    | Rounds its argument to the nearest integer                    |\n",

    "\n",
    "The expression `5 - 2` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `5 - 2` combines the expressions `5` and `2` by subtraction.  In this case, `5` and `2` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to think about this is that we're **evaluating the right-hand side** of the equals sign and **assigning it to the left-hand side**. Here are some assignment statements:\n",

    "* `height = 1.3`\n",
    "* `the_number_five = abs(-5)`\n",
    "* `absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)`\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",
