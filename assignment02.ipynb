You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on a question, so ask a post to the discussion board or ask your instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",
